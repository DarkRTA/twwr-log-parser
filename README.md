# TWWR Spoiler Log Parser

This small rust crate is meant to assist with parsing and extracting data from
spoiler logs generated by the [Wind Waker
Randomizer](https://github.com/lagolunatic/wwrando).

The entire interface is a single function and it should be very obvious how to
use this library after 30 seconds of looking at its source code.

## Usage

Add the following to your Cargo.toml

```toml
[dependencies]
twwr-log-parser = { git = "https://github.com/DarkRTA/twwr-log-parser.git" }
```

Parse your spoiler log.

```rust
fn main() {
	let log = twwr_log_parser::parse_log("log.txt");
	// do stuff with the parsed spoiler log
}
```
